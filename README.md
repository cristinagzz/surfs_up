The maximum temperature is seen in June with 85F but it is slightly different to the temperature of december with 83F while the precipitation is higher in december with a difference of 1.99 inch.

## Summary

The tables and plots seen above can help us visualize the difference temperatures and precipitations on June and December on Oahu.
Through this information we can see the temperature is very similar on both months so the Surf and Ice Cream will be a good option on both months.
